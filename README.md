## Introduction

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and training deep neural networks. In this repository, I've documented my journey of learning PyTorch, starting from the basics of tensors to more advanced topics.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and PyTorch installed on your system. You can install PyTorch using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

For more detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:
